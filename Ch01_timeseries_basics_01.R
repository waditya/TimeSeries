# Chapter -1 Exploratory time series data analysis

# Print the Nile dataset
print(Nile)

# List the number of observations in the Nile dataset

length(Nile)
# Display the first 10 elements of the Nile dataset
head(Nile, n = 10)

# Display the last 12 elements of the Nile dataset

tail(Nile, n = 12)

# Plot the Nile data
plot(Nile)

# Plot the Nile data with xlab and ylab arguments

# Plot AirPassengers
